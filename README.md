Chosen:  Node over Python.  Need time to get stronger in Python though many of the code concepts should transfer gracefully.

Build using a node command line prompt.  The underlying functions would be easy enough to put into use in other places or put into an API, etc.

Use of imported libraries?  I've chosen to use imported libraries - though if necessary these could be extracted and the necessary parts imported directly.
